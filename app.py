            The main aim of this project is to predict the price of used cars using various Machine Learning (ML) models.
            Steps Involved
            Data Cleaning which involves identifying all the null and missing values and removing the outliers
            The next process is Data Preprocessing which involves us normalising and standardize the dataset
            We then use the different Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, KNN
            We then need to compare the performance of any of the models used
            Now, gather insights and analyze the data based on the accuracy test""")
